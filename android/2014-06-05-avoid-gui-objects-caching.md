## Details 

On Android, application screens are retained in memory and entire applications can be retained in memory because of multitasking. An attacker who finds or steals a device is able to navigate directly to previously used screens that are still retained and see any data still shown on the GUI. An example of this would be a banking application where a user views their transaction history and then “logs out” of the application. By launching the transaction view activity directly the attacker can see the previous transactions that were displayed.

## Remediation

To counter this, a developer has three common options:

1. Quit the app entirely when the user logs out. It is against Android design principles to quit your own app but it is more secure as the GUI gets destroyed/recycled.

2. Perform a test at the start of each Activity/screen to check if the user is in a logged in state, if not, switch to the login screen.

3. Nullify the data on a GUI screen before leaving the screen or logging out.
