## Details 

When sending a broadcast Intent, if no permission is set then any unprivileged app can receive the Intent unless it has an explicit destination.  There is no restriction on a malicious developer creating an app with the exact same component name as a legitimate component, and as long as the namespace is not in use already the malicious app will install.

## Remediation

Use permissions to protect Intents in your application and consider that if you are sending sensitive information via a broadcast Intent to a 3rd party component then the component could have been replaced by a malicious install.
