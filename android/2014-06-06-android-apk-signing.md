## Details 

APKs should be signed correctly with a non-expired certificate.

## Remediation

- Sign a production app with a production certificate, not a debug certificate
- Make sure the certificate includes a sufficient validity period (i.e., won't expire during the expected lifespan of the app)
- Google recommends that your certificate use at least 2048-bit encryption
- Make sure the keystore containing the signing key is properly protected
- Also, restrict access to the keystore to only those people that absolutely require it

Here's an example of a Keytool command that generates a private key:

```
$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```
