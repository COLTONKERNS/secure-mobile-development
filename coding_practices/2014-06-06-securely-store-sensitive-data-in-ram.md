## Details 

During application use, user or application specific data could be stored in RAM and not cleared properly upon user logout or session timeout. On Android, because an application stays in memory after use until the memory needs to be reclaimed, encryption keys can linger in the background. An attacker who finds or steals the device can attach a debugger and dump the memory from the application, or load a kernel module to dump the entire contents of RAM.

## Remediation

When using sensitive data such as encryption keys, do not keep them in RAM longer than required. Variables holding keys should be nullified after use. Avoid using immutable objects for sensitive keys/passwords such as in Android java.lang.String and favour char array instead. This is because even when references to immutable objects are removed/nulled they made still be present in memory until garbage collection which cannot be forced by the app.
