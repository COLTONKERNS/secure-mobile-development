## Details 

iOS developers often store application settings in plist files which can be compromised in some situations. Similarly, Android developers often store settings in a shared preferences XML file or SQLite databases, which are not encrypted by default and can be read or even modified with root permissions, or using backup procedures.

## Remediation

Compile settings into the code when possible. There is little benefit to configuring an app via plist file on iOS since changes must be bundled and deployed as a new app anyway. Instead, include configuration inside app code which requires more time and skill for attackers to modify.  Donâ€™t store any critical settings in dictionaries or other files unless encrypted first. Ideally, encrypt all configuration files using a master key encrypted with a passphrase that is supplied by the user, or with a key provided remotely when a user logs into a system.
